# Feature Ideas

## 1. Support for More Weather Conditions

**Current Functionality:**

The application currently provides weather alerts specifically for:

*   Snowfall
*   Rainfall

**Proposal:**

We propose extending the application's capabilities to support a wider range of weather conditions. This would allow users to receive alerts and information for conditions such as:

*   **Wind Speed:** Alerts for high wind speeds, which can be crucial for safety and planning outdoor activities.
*   **UV Index:** Notifications for high UV index levels, helping users take precautions against sun exposure.
*   **Air Quality Index (AQI):** Alerts for poor air quality, which is increasingly important for health-conscious users.
*   Other potential conditions: Fog, hail, thunderstorms, extreme temperatures (high/low).

**Impact:**

Implementing this feature would require modifications across several parts of the application:

*   **Data Model:** The existing data model would need to be updated to accommodate new data points for these additional weather conditions. This might involve adding new fields to existing tables or creating new tables to store this information.
*   **User Interface (UI):** The UI would need to be redesigned to:
    *   Allow users to select and configure alerts for these new conditions.
    *   Display information related to these conditions in a clear and intuitive manner.
*   **Alert Logic:** The backend alert generation logic would need to be significantly updated to process these new conditions and trigger alerts accordingly. This includes fetching new data sources if required and implementing the rules for each new alert type.

This enhancement would significantly increase the value proposition of our weather application, making it a more comprehensive and indispensable tool for users.

## 2. Location-Based Alerts

**Current Functionality:**

Currently, users need to manually input and manage the locations for which they want to receive weather alerts. The application does not automatically detect the user's current location.

**Proposal:**

We propose implementing location-based alerts. This feature would enable the application to:

*   Optionally, use the device's GPS or other location services (with user permission) to determine the user's current geographical location.
*   Provide timely and relevant weather alerts for this automatically detected current location.
*   Users could still have the option to add and receive alerts for manually specified locations in addition to their current location.

**Impact:**

Adding this feature will involve several key changes:

*   **Permissions:** The application will need to request location permissions from the user (e.g., on Android and iOS).
*   **Location Services Integration:** We will need to integrate with the device's native location services to fetch the current location reliably and efficiently (considering battery life).
*   **UI/UX Changes:**
    *   Provide clear options for users to enable/disable location-based alerts.
    *   Display information indicating that alerts are for the current location.
*   **Backend Logic:** The logic for fetching and processing weather data will need to be adapted to handle dynamically changing locations. This includes potentially more frequent API calls to weather services for the current location.
*   **Privacy Considerations:** We must clearly communicate how location data is used and ensure user privacy is protected.

Location-based alerts would make the application significantly more convenient and contextually aware, providing users with immediate weather information relevant to their surroundings without manual input.

## 3. Snooze/Dismiss Alert Functionality

**Current Functionality:**

Once an alert is triggered and a notification is sent to the user, there is currently no built-in way for the user to temporarily silence or dismiss that specific alert. If the conditions persist, the user might receive repeated notifications, which could become intrusive.

**Proposal:**

We propose introducing functionality that allows users to "snooze" or "dismiss" active weather alerts:

*   **Snooze:** Users could choose to temporarily postpone an alert notification for a predefined or user-configurable period (e.g., 1 hour, 3 hours, until next morning). After the snooze period, if the alert condition is still met, the notification would reappear.
*   **Dismiss:** Users could choose to dismiss an alert for the current weather event or for a longer, user-defined period (e.g., "don't show again today," "don't show for this specific event type for X days"). This would prevent further notifications for that particular alert instance or type, depending on the option chosen.

**Impact:**

Implementing snooze/dismiss functionality would require:

*   **Notification Handling:** The notification system would need to be enhanced to include "Snooze" and "Dismiss" actions directly within the notification itself (e.g., using notification buttons on Android/iOS).
*   **Alert State Management:** The backend or client-side logic would need to maintain the state of snoozed or dismissed alerts (e.g., store snooze expiry times, track dismissed event IDs or types).
*   **UI/UX Adjustments:**
    *   Potentially, a section in the app settings where users can see and manage their snoozed/dismissed alerts or configure default snooze/dismiss durations.
    *   Clear visual feedback when an alert has been snoozed or dismissed.
*   **Alert Logic Modification:** The alert generation logic would need to check against the snooze/dismiss state before re-notifying the user for an ongoing or recurring event.

This feature would give users more control over the notifications they receive, reducing notification fatigue and improving the overall user experience by making alerts less intrusive when immediate attention is not required.
